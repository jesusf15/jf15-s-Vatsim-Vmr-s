# jf15-s-Vatsim-Vmr-s
Alright boys I've been owing this to you boys for a while now. I have created a github with 2 VMR files for vatsim. The zip includes a GA/business jet/military only vmr, and a Commandair+GA vmr combined into one so you only need one vmr. You can choose to only use the GA one if you're not a part of Commandair. But if you're a part of both then I recommend using the one that has both combined.

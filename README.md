# jf15-s-Vatsim-Vmr-s
Alright boys I've been owing this to you boys for a while now. I have created a github with 2 VMR files for vatsim. The zip includes a GA/business jet/military only vmr, and a Commandair+GA vmr combined into one so you only need one vmr. You can choose to only use the GA one if you're not a part of Commandair. But if you're a part of both then I recommend using the one that has both combined.
The 3rd file in here has the link to dowloading the library file for some extra GA aircraft. Simply download it, unzip the zip file, and drag it into your MSFS community folder!!
